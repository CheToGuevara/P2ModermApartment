# P2ModermApartment
Built a new apartment. Added lights, animation, and view it all in VR.


#Goals in this Project
* __Custom Skybox__: I create a new skybox with a pirate ship in the back.
* __Custom Shader__: I create a shader to get a Marble which changes color over time.
* __Camera Animation__: I create a path to the camera to follow the marble ball through the room.
* __Pusher Animation__: I create a box that push the ball to change it the direction.
* __Baked Lights__: I modify the baked lights, I added the TV blue light, and the monitor is not baked because it is moving.
* __Custom models__: I create a spiral ramp in blender and I added.
* __Globe Model__ : I added the globe as the project says.
