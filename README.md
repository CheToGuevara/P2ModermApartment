# P2ModermApartment
Built a new apartment. Added lights, animation, and view it all in VR.


#Goals in this Project
* __Custom Skybox__: I create a new skybox with a pirate ship in the back
* __Custom Shader__: I create a shader to get a Marble which changes color over time 
* __Camera Animation__: I create a path to the camera to follow the marble ball through the room
* __Baked Lights__: I modify the baked lights, I added the TV blue light, and the monitor is not baked because it is moving.
* __Custom models__: I create a spiral ramp in blender and I added.
