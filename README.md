# P2ModermApartment
Built a new apartment. Added lights, animation, and view it all in VR.


#Goals in this Project
* Custom Skybox: I create a new skybox with a pirate ship in the back
* Custom Shader: I create a shader to get a Marble which changes color over time 
* Camera Animation: I create a path to the camera to follow the marble ball through the room
* Baked Lights: I modify the baked lights, I added the TV blue light, and the monitor is not baked because it is moving.
